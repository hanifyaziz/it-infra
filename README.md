o	Error messages during deployment (e.g., "Failed to apply image").
o	Target machine does not boot into the deployed OS.
•	Resolution:
o	Verify network connectivity between the SmartDeploy server and target machines.
o	Ensure the target machine meets hardware requirements for the OS being deployed.
o	Check the deployment logs (C:\Windows\Panther\UnattendGC\setupact.log) for errors.
o	Update SmartDeploy to the latest version.
2. Driver Issues
•	Symptoms:
o	Target machine has missing or incorrect drivers after deployment.
o	Devices (e.g., network cards, storage controllers) not functioning properly.
•	Resolution:
o	Use SmartDeploy's Platform Pack for the specific hardware model.
o	Manually inject missing drivers into the image using the Driver Injection Wizard.
o	Verify that the correct drivers are included in the deployment package.
3. Network Boot (PXE) Issues
•	Symptoms:
o	Target machine fails to boot via PXE.
o	PXE boot process hangs or displays errors (e.g., "PXE-E53: No boot filename received").
•	Resolution:
o	Ensure the DHCP server is configured correctly (e.g., options 66 and 67 for PXE boot).
o	Verify that the SmartDeploy PXE service is running.
o	Check network settings and firewall rules to allow PXE traffic.
4. Image Creation Problems
•	Symptoms:

o	Custom scripts or configurations are not applied.
•	Resolution:
o	Verify post-deployment scripts and configurations in the deployment package.
o	Use the Post-Deployment Task feature in SmartDeploy.
